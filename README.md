## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-based content moderation system for social media platforms to accurately detect and mitigate the spread of harmful content, including misinformation, hate speech, and cyberbullying. The goal is to create a more trustworthy and safer online environment by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP).

## Key Objectives

1. **Improve Accuracy:** Enhance the accuracy of AI models in distinguishing between harmful and benign content.
2. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Develop models that can understand context, cultural nuances, and sarcasm to improve content moderation.
3. **Ensure Scalability:** Implement scalable AI architectures to handle large volumes of content in real-time.
4. **Promote Fairness:** Mitigate biases in AI models to ensure fair and equitable moderation practices.
5. **Protect User Privacy:** Ensure compliance with privacy regulations and protect user data through anonymization and encryption.
6. **Increase Transparency:** Provide clear explanations for moderation decisions and implement user feedback mechanisms.
7. **Real-time Detection:** Develop real-time processing capabilities to quickly identify and flag harmful content.
